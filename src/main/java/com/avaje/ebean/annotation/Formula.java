/**
 * Assign to a property to be based on a SQL formula.
 * <p>
 * This is typically a SQL Literal value, SQL case statement, SQL function or
 * similar.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any property based on a formula becomes a read only property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You may also put use the Transient annotation with the Formula annotation.
 * The effect of the Transient annotation in this case is that the formula will
 * <b>NOT</b> be included in queries by default - you have to explicitly include
 * it via {@link Query#select(String)} or {@link Query#join(String, String)}.
 * You may want to do this if the Formula is relatively expensive and only want
 * it included in the query when you explicitly state it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="code">
 * // On the Order &quot;master&quot; bean
 * // ... a formula using the Order details
 * // ... sum(order_qty*unit_price) 
 * &#064;Transient
 * &#064;Formula(select = &quot;_b${ta}.total_amount&quot;, join = &quot;join (select order_id, sum(order_qty*unit_price) as total_amount from o_order_detail group by order_id) as _b${ta} on _b${ta}.order_id = ${ta}.id&quot;)
 * Double totalAmount;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * As the totalAmount formula is also Transient it is not included by default in
 * queries - it needs to be explicitly included.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="code">
 *  // find by Id
 * Order o1 = Ebean.find(Order.class)
 *         .select(&quot;id, totalAmount&quot;)
 *         .setId(1).findUnique();
 * 
 *  // find list ... using totalAmount in the where clause
 * List&lt;Order&gt; list = Ebean.find(Order.class)
 *      .select(&quot;id, totalAmount&quot;)
 *      .where()
 *        .eq(&quot;status&quot;,Order.Status.NEW)
 *        .gt(&quot;totalAmount&quot;, 10)
 * 		.findList();
 * 
 *  // as a join from customer
 * List&lt;Customer&gt; l0 = Ebean.find(Customer.class)
 *      .select(&quot;id, name&quot;)
 *      .join(&quot;orders&quot;, &quot;status, totalAmount&quot;)
 *      .where()
 *        .gt(&quot;id&quot;, 0)
 *        .gt(&quot;orders.totalAmount&quot;, 10)
 *      .findList();
