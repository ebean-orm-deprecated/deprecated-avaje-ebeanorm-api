/**
 * Used to enhance or override the default bean persistence mechanism.
 * <p>
 * Note that if want to totally change the finding, you need to use a BeanFinder
 * rather than using postLoad().
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that getTransaction() on the PersistRequest returns the transaction used
 * for the insert, update, delete or fetch. To explicitly use this same
 * transaction you should use this transaction via methods on EbeanServer.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="code">
 * 
 *        Object extaBeanToSave = ...;
 *        Transaction t = request.getTransaction();
 *        EbeanServer server = request.getEbeanServer();
 *        server.save(extraBeanToSave, t);
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is worth noting that BeanPersistListener is different in three main ways
 * from BeanPersistController postXXX methods.
 * <ul>
 * <li>BeanPersistListener only sees successfully committed events.
 * BeanController pre and post methods occur before the commit or a rollback and
 * will see events that are later rolled back</li>
 * <li>BeanPersistListener runs in a background thread and will not effect the
 * response time of the actual persist where as BeanController code will</li>
 * <li>BeanPersistListener can be notified of events from other servers in a
 * cluster.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A BeanPersistController is either found automatically via class path search
 * or can be added programmatically via ServerConfiguration.addEntity().
 * </p>
